# ANIOB UX Copy Deck

Single source of truth for every user-visible string (UX-0 §4, finalized in UX-7). Strings shipped
in `strings.xml` or rendered by composables must match this deck. Technical names (FAST_PATH,
OMNIROUTE_CLOUD, OMNIROUTE_API_KEY, M0, "32dp", "hierarchies", screen hashes) live behind a
"Details" affordance only — never on a user surface. The product name **OmniRoute** is the one
exception: it names the gateway the user is asked to connect, so the Cloud AI card may use it.

## Ban list (CI-enforced in UX-7)

`M0`, `32dp`, `hierarchies`, `actuates`, `FAST_PATH`, `OMNIROUTE_` (internal identifier spelling),
`Pre-flight`.

## Cloud AI / Settings (UX-7)

The product name **OmniRoute** is allowed here even though internal identifiers
(`OMNIROUTE_CLOUD`, `OMNIROUTE_API_KEY`) are banned; the user is connecting that gateway.

| Slot | Copy |
|---|---|
| Card title | Cloud AI (OmniRoute) |
| Card body | Add the key from your OmniRoute dashboard for fast answers and cloud automation. |
| Gateway label | Gateway address |
| Gateway placeholder | http://192.168.1.20:20128/v1 |
| Gateway helper | Where OmniRoute runs. Plain http is accepted on your local network only. |
| Key label | OmniRoute key |
| Key placeholder | Paste the key from your dashboard |
| Model chip | Auto / Coding / Fast / Cheap |
| Model label | Model name |
| Model helper | auto lets OmniRoute choose. Any provider/model name from the dashboard also works. |
| Test | Test |
| Testing | Testing connection… |
| Save | Save |
| Details | Details |
| Setup guide | Setup guide |
| Banner saved | Saved |
| Banner connected | Connected |
| Banner bad key | Key rejected |
| Banner unreachable | Gateway unreachable |
| Banner invalid | Check these details |
| Save body | Saved. Run Test connection to confirm the gateway answers. |
| Cloud off body | Cloud AI is off. Add a key whenever you want it back. |
| Connected body | The gateway answered for this key. Save to keep it. |
| Bad key body | The gateway rejected this key. Copy it again from the OmniRoute dashboard. |
| Unreachable body | No usable answer from that address. Check Wi-Fi and the address, confirm OmniRoute is running, and that it has at least one provider connected. |
| Missing key | Add the key from your OmniRoute dashboard. |
| Missing address | Add the address of the computer running OmniRoute. |
| No secure storage | This device cannot store the key securely, so Cloud AI stays off. |
| Missing address hint | Add the gateway address to finish cloud setup. |
| Thinking dialog cloud | Cloud: ready (model) / Cloud: not set up |
| Brain step body | On-device (private) or cloud (fast). Cloud setup lives in Settings. |

## Research mode (study build)

The ablation selector is a study surface, not a consumer setting: the labels name the exact
condition so a run in `research_runs.csv` can be traced back to what the agent did. Mode ids
(`BASELINE`, `INTENT_SHORTCUT_ONLY`, `MOTIF_AND_FAST_OBSERVE`, `FULL_HUMAN_SPEED`) stay internal —
they appear only in the CSV, the log tag and the bracketed HUD prefix, never as prose.

| Slot | Copy |
|---|---|
| Settings card title | Research mode |
| Settings card body | Pick the condition before a test batch. It changes how the agent works, not what it can do. |
| Settings card footer | Each finished task is appended to research_runs.csv; averages are kept in research_summary_table.csv inside the app's files folder. |
| Mode label — baseline | Baseline |
| Mode body — baseline | Full observation every step, one action per model call. No shortcuts, no replay. |
| Mode label — shortcuts | Shortcuts only |
| Mode body — shortcuts | Direct intent shortcuts are on; every remaining step uses the standard loop. |
| Mode label — motif | Motif + fast capture |
| Mode body — motif | Shortcuts, multi-action bursts and the event-driven capture skip. |
| Mode label — full | Full human speed |
| Mode body — full | Every mechanism, including verified replay from remembered tasks. |
| Stats card title | Research metrics |
| Stats empty | No task measured yet in this install. |
| Stats mean latency | Mean latency |
| Stats mean calls | Mean model requests per task |
| Stats success | Task success rate |
| Stats runs | Runs in this mode |
| Stats verdict manual | Last verdict was set manually. |
| Stats verdict auto | Last verdict came from automatic verification. |
| Stats override pass | Mark pass |
| Stats override fail | Mark fail |
| Stats clear | Clear saved runs |

End-of-task HUD (Stats line and the one-shot Toast), format fixed for the paper:

`[MODE] Latency: 12.35s | LLM Calls: 2 | Success Rate: 66.7%`
