/**
 * One experimental condition of the ablation study.
 *
 * Each mode states which of the agent's speed mechanisms may run for a task. The flags are applied
 * once per task by `AniobViewModel.applyAblationMode`, which flips the real switches (the router's
 * intent-shortcut lookup, FastPath replay, the observe-burst policy and the event-driven capture
 * skip) — nothing here is a placebo label.
 *
 * | mode | intent shortcut | action bursts | fast delta | remember replay |
 * |---|---|---|---|---|
 * | [BASELINE] | off | off | off | off |
 * | [INTENT_SHORTCUT_ONLY] | on | off | off | off |
 * | [BURST_AND_FAST_OBSERVE] | on | on | on | off |
 * | [FULL_HUMAN_SPEED] | on | on | on | on |
 *
 * Node pruning (`AniobTokenOptimizer`) is NOT an ablation flag: it is the hard 60-node cap every
 * request depends on, so it stays on in all four modes. That is the only mechanism that does not
 * vary across this table.
 *
 * [FULL_HUMAN_SPEED] is the default because it preserves the behaviour the app had before the
 * study existed; the other modes are opt-in degradations for measurement.
 *
 * The compact observe pipeline ([fastObservation]) is part of the burst conditions: it prunes and
 * merges the live tree, gives every surviving element a sequential id and skips the screenshot
 * when the tree is dense enough to plan from.
