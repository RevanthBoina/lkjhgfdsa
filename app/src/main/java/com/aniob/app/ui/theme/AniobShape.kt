/*
 * ANIOB SHAPE SCALE
 * -----------------
 * The old build passed no `shapes` to MaterialTheme and then hardcoded
 * RoundedCornerShape(12/16/24/28.dp) in six files, so a Card on the chat screen and a
 * Card on the models screen had different radii for no reason.
 *
 * One scale, one meaning per step:
 *   xs  4dp   progress tracks, hairline chips
 *   s   10dp  dense rows, inline badges
 *   m   16dp  the default: cards, banners, sheets-in-content
 *   l   22dp  elevated surfaces that float over content
 *   xl  30dp  bottom sheets, dialogs, the composer
