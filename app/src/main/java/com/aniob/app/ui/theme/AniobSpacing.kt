/*
 * ANIOB SPACING + SIZING TOKENS
 * -----------------------------
 * Measured in the old build: 76 uses of 8.dp, 52 of 16.dp, 39 of 12.dp, 32 of 4.dp,
 * 18 of 6.dp, 18 of 10.dp, plus one-offs at 14/18/20/54/72/90.dp. Six of those values
 * are off the 4dp grid, which is exactly why the screens feel "almost aligned but not".
 *
 * This is a 4dp grid with named intent. If a value you need is not here, the layout
 * is probably wrong — not the scale.
