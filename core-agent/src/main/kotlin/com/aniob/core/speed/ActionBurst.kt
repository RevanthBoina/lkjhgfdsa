/**
 * Plan-5.4 — ACTION BURSTS for transient UI.
 *
 * 2..N turn-ending actions submitted together and executed back to back with no gate, no retry
 * and no screenshot between them. First failure aborts the rest.
 *
 * This is the only way to hit auto-fading control bars, snackbar buttons, toasts with actions and
 * short-lived menus: by the next turn those targets are GONE, so a one-action-per-observation loop
 * structurally cannot reach them.
 *
 * It is also the single most abusable feature in the whole plan — "batch the next five taps for
 * speed" throws away every safety property the loop has. The constraints below are therefore
 * enforced in code, not requested in a prompt.
