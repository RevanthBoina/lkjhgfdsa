/**
 * The single seam through which the agent gets smarter.
 *
 * Before this interface existed, five learning systems (HippocampusTracker, ReplayEngine,
 * SkillDistiller, SemanticSkillMatcher, AppKnowledgeBase) each accumulated knowledge in its own
 * store and none of them talked. `LearningPipeline` gives one stage-owned path:
 *
 * ```
 * verified trajectory -> fastpath entry (now)
 *                     -> distill candidacy (signature match count)
 *                     -> skill YAML       (>= threshold)
 *                     -> indexed + persisted
 * ```
 *
 * Callers must only invoke these for **verified** outcomes; failures must never distill.
