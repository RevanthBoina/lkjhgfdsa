/**
 * Plan-7.8 — confirmations must fire for everything hard to reverse.
 *
 * Today `AniobSafetyInterceptor` only raises a confirmation when the MODEL volunteers one
 * (`AniobAction.ConfirmWithUser`), so a tap on a button labelled "Send" is LOW risk and dispatches
 * silently. Whether the user is asked therefore depends on whether the model felt like asking,
 * which is exactly backwards.
 *
 * Classification here is by CONSEQUENCE (does this send, post, delete, pay, share, call?) and by
 * REVERSIBILITY (easily undone / hard to undo / irreversible), computed from the TARGET LABEL —
 * the thing that is actually true about the button — rather than from the model's narration.
